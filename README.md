# Venezuelan Primera DivisiÃ³n 2025 â€“ Dashboard Project

This project builds a complete dashboard for the **2025 Venezuelan Primera DivisiÃ³n** season.

Using Python and Power BI, I collected match and player data, cleaned it, and organized it into a structured model.  
The final dashboard tracks team performances, player stats, goals, wins, losses, and standings across the season.
